# Portfolio Website - Nicolas Arlandis

This is the repository of my portfolio website, containing information about me and my work. The site is built using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, and there are some essential images in the "images" folder for the full visual experience of the site.

## Viewing the Site

To view the site, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the cloned folder.

3. Open the `index.html` file in your favorite browser to see the site in action.

## Directory Structure

- `index.html`: The main website file.
- `styles.css`: This folder contains the CSS files used to style the site.
